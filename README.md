# Attrition
End-to-end machine learning project completed for academic purposes. The aim of this project is to predict the monthly salaries of employees of the synthetic IBM HR analytics employee attrition and performance dataset

The objective of the current synthetic dataset was to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.

Description of categorical variables: 
Education : (1: 'Below College',2: 'College', 3: 'Bachelor', 4: 'Master', 5: 'Doctor')

EnvironmentSatisfaction: (1: 'Low', 2: 'Medium', 3: 'High', 4: 'Very High')

JobInvolvement: (1: 'Low', 2: 'Medium',3: 'High', 4: 'Very High')

JobSatisfaction: (1: 'Low', 2: 'Medium',3: 'High', 4: 'Very High')

PerformanceRating: (1: 'Low', 2: 'Good', 3: 'Excellent', 4: 'Outstanding')

RelationshipSatisfaction: (1: 'Low', 2: 'Medium', 3: 'High', 4: 'Very High')

WorkLifeBalance: (1: 'Bad', 2: 'Good', 3: 'Better', 4: 'Best')

For the purpose of this project, a continuous variable was predicted (monthly salary) using valid predictors available from the Attrition dataset.
